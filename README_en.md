# Visionect Joan for Home Assistant

A custom integration that displays essential information from the **Joan 6** e-ink tablet by Visionect in Home Assistant. It also allows you to send custom URLs, text, and images directly from HA.

This enables powerful automations, such as sending low battery notifications, displaying sensor states on the tablet, or pushing images for alerts before returning to your Appdaemon dashboard.
